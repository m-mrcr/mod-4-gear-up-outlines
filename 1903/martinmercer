  Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Don't Forget Your Humanity
  
  Talking points for your presentation:
    - Introduction
      - Thesis
        - "The integration of the Humanities into STEM fields is crucial as we continue expanding our global society."
      - Monolithic entities with global impact can have a homogenizing effect if production is centrally located.
      - Those entities can find greater success and influence in those cultures by employing humanitarian ideals
        - We know the humanities help:
            - broaden our global views
            - broaden our intellectual foundations
            - teach clear and effective communication
            - teach creative and critical thinking skills
            - teach us abstract reasoning and problem solving
            - foster engaged thinkers and citizens
            - help us to understand the impact that science, technology, and medicine have had on society
    - Definitions
      - What is STEM?
      - What is Humanitarian Study?
  
  2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. Where do they come from: Brief History of Non-STEM Study & its impact (this would include references to Greek philosophy and the enlightenment, but also to modern civil rights movements and their origins)
    2. The Expanding Self: Learning about society and the self takes more than day to day experience, it takes exposure to new ideas. Otherwise every social transaction reiterates Mother Cultural values.
    3. Tech is not an end in and of itself -- Humanities offers insight into the ends. (This is what got us into this Facebook mess with privacy and Transgender names.)
